  template_loader.py is responsible for loading the templates and passing them to the Jinja2 environment.

  htmx/templates contains the htmx template files.

  htmx folder inside the static/js contains the htmx JavaScript library and any custom JavaScript code for your application.

  Updated the "app.py" file with the htmx functionality using the `htmx_model` decorator.

  Updated the `routes.py` file with routes for the htmx endpoints.

  Updated the "settings.py" file with the configuration for the htmx functionality, including any necessary settings for AJAX calls and event handling.

  Updated the "models.py" file with any necessary data models required by the htmx components in your application.

  If you're using a database, updated the "requirements.txt" file with the necessary packages for database integration.

  Updated the "views.py" file with the view functions that will handle the AJAX calls and update the templates accordingly.

  The `settings.py` file should also include the necessary settings for the Jinja2 environment and the htmx integration.

  Make sure to add the `static/js/script.js` file to the `index.html` page so that the htmx JavaScript library is loaded during runtime.

  If you're using a template engine like Jinja2, remember to extend the base template in your `index.html` and include the necessary HTML elements for htmx.

  When handling AJAX calls in the `views.py` file, remember to return a JSON response with the updated data.

  If you're using a database, remember to update the `models.py` file with the necessary data models.
