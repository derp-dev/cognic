I recommend obtaining MinGW through MSys2 [https://www.msys2.org/](https://www.msys2.org/)

First install MSys2, then perform a full update by first updating the package database and updating pacman

```
pacman -SySu
```

After the update is done it will ask you to close the terminal without exiting to shell. Do so, then perform a full update by running

```
pacman -Su
```

after which you can install the mingw-w64 packages. Use

```
pacman -Ss mingw
```

to list all available packages. Install with

```
pacman -S ${PACKAGE_NAME}
```
