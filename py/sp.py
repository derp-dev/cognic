"""
This Python script defines a function called 
dive_thoughts
 that takes an input string, processes it using the Spacy NLP model 'en_core_web_sm', and returns a string representation of a dictionary containing information about each token in the input string.

Here are the key functions and their descriptions:

spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
: This function loads the English language model 'en_core_web_sm' from Spacy. This model is used for various NLP tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, etc.

nlp(input_string)
: This function processes the input string using the loaded Spacy model and returns a Doc object. This object contains a sequence of Token objects, which can be iterated over to access information about each token.

dive_thoughts(input_string)
: This is the main function defined in the script. It takes an input string, processes it using the Spacy model, and returns a string representation of a dictionary containing information about each token in the input string.

Please note that the script contains references to 
token.edge
 and 
token.state
 which are not standard attributes of Spacy's Token object. It seems like these attributes are expected to be added to the Token object somewhere else in the code, which is not included in the provided script. If these attributes are not added elsewhere, the script will throw an error.
